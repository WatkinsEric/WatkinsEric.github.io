<div>Assignment 1 CMPT395</div>
<p>
Recently I found a very interesting developer of free and open source software for CMPT395. The developer I found was a Dr Linas Vepstas, who is the primary maintainer and developer of the OpenCog's linguist module(RelEx) and also assists OpenCog in many other respects.  OpenCog is a non-profit organization dedicated to building a artificial general intelligence, the RelEx module is built to analyzes language structure in English.  RelEx is used by OpenCog in the converting of English to machine code thereby enabling machines to understand what people are saying in essence. This is incredibly important in the development of a AGI, an artificial intelligence that can do multiple functions and can understand natural sentence structure of humans. RelEx allows for the understanding of context in English, when used in conjunction with the other parts of OpenCog. Linas has also worked for  IBM, and has recently been working on the Linxus kernel for  Power architecture-based mainframes which I discovered when reading his web-page http://linas.org/, he also has a blog about consciousness and machines on http://blog.opencog.org/2014/01/17/what-is-consciousness/ where he discusses if the implementation of consciousness in a machine is possible within the OpenCog's framework, he believes it is. I however think he is being too optimistic in the regards of developing an actual conscious machine, for the machine to be conscious as he outlines it not only has to hold a internal model of the external world, but also have an internal model of self, along with an internal model of attentional focus. These things would be incredibly difficult to implement all together, especially when you begin to provide sensory, motor and language input all at once. This is also why I believe that the OpenCog's time line on their website is highly unlikely to be met, due to the fact that they are predicting the development of an AI of human intelligence by the year 2019-2021. While I believe that the development of such an AI is possible, I think that it is highly unlikely to be developed within the next six years. I think it is far more likely that any AI's developed within that time frame, will excel at certain tasks such as either communication, or moving around in a dynamic environment but will not be able to do both. Human's intelligence is not just our ability to process numbers, or carry on a conversation, but it is a combinations of all the things we are capable of which makes it highly unlikely that a machine that is equal to mankind's' intellect will be developed. That said I'm still looking forward to the developments in the field of AI and who knows maybe I'm wrong, maybe they will develop a machine that is our equal within that time, if so i greatly anticipate seeing it in action.</p>
